### 1. 3 points (Based on ROS 5.2)

The logarithms of weights (in pounds) of men in the Unite States are approximately normally distributed with mean 5.13 and standard deviation of 0.17; women's log weights are approximately normally distributed with mean 4.96 and standard deviation of 0.20. Suppose 10 adults selected at random step on an elevator with a capacity of 1750 pounds. What is the probability that their total weight exceeds this limit?

Clearly state any assumptions that you make in calculating this probability.

### 2. 4 points (Based on ROS 5.4)
For the following values of n = (5, 20, 50, 100), let x = x1 + ... + xn, the sum of n independent uniform random variables. In R, create 1000 simulations of x (for each n) and plot their histogram. For each n, what is the normal approximation from the CLT (note you'll need the standard deviation of a uniform random variable). Overlay the normal density on top of each histogram and comment on any differences between the histogram and curve.
